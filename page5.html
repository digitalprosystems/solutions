<br><br>5. Customer acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the Services including without limitation, any modifications, enhancements and updates, and any originals and copies thereof, in whole or in part, and all intellectual property rights therein (collectively, " Proprietary Information") are owned by us and/or our third party sponsors, partners, and other co-branders (collectively, " Content Providers"), (b) the Proprietary Information contains valuable copyrighted material and is protected by U.S. and international copyright and other intellectual property laws, (c) the Proprietary Information is licensed, rather than sold, to Customer pursuant to these Terms, and (d) Customer has no rights to the Proprietary Information, other than the rights and licenses granted to Customer herein.

In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, design and user interface elements, and scripts are service marks, trademarks, and/or trade dress of ours and may not be copied, imitated, or used, in whole or in part without our prior written permission, which consent may be withheld in our sole discretion. All other marks or logos not owned by us are the property of their respective owners.
<br><br>7. Reservation of Rights.

<br><br><strong>DISPUTES REGARDING ACCOUNT OR SITE OWNERSHIP</strong>
<br>1. The entity or person creating an account with us and designated as the owner will be deemed the account owner. For security reasons, only the account owner or the point of contact designated by the account owner will be allowed to make changes, cancellations, or designate a new point of contact. Disputes sometimes arise between or among multiple persons claiming ownership of or rights in a site, store or account. We are not obligated to, and will not, resolve any such disputes.
<br><br>2. If multiple persons are claiming ownership of or rights in a site, store or account, and, in our sole judgment, there is uncertainty as to the ownership of or rights in such site, store or account, then we will, to the extent of its knowledge and ability, notify such persons of the dispute and demand that such persons promptly, conclusively, and finally resolve the dispute in a manner which makes clear who the owner(s) and/or interest holder(s) is/are and in a manner which relieves us of all liability and obligations concerning the dispute and such site, store or account. If the disputing persons fail to resolve the dispute within what we, in our sole judgment, deems to be a reasonable time, then we, at our sole option and without any obligation to do so, may suspend or terminate the account until such persons resolve such dispute and reach certainty regarding ownership of or rights in such website, store and/or account. The person or persons conclusively and finally determined by court order, binding arbitration or settlement agreement to be the rightful owner(s) or interest holder(s) of such website, store and/or account will be obligated to pay all amounts due and comply with the then current policy of ours regarding transfers of accounts, if required, to transfer ownership of the site, store and/or account to the rightful owner. Failure of the rightful owner of such site, store and/or account to timely pay in full all of such amounts will be deemed a breach of these Terms and will subject the account to immediate termination.
<br><br><strong>CUSTOMER'S NAME, TRADEMARKS, FEEDBACK AND SUBMISSIONS</strong>
<br>1. Name and Trademarks. Customer hereby grants us a non-exclusive right and license to use Customer’s name and such of Customer’s trade names, trademarks, service marks and logos ("Customer’s Marks") as are used by Customer on Customer’s hosted sites in connection with this Agreement, and images and publically-facing information about Customer on Customer’s hosted sites including, but not limited to, screenshots of Customer’s hosted sites and associated photographs appearing on Customer’s hosted sites ("Customer Public Information and Images"): (a) on our own websites describing and promoting our Services, (b) in printed and online advertising, publicity, directories, newsletters and updates describing and promoting our Services, and (c) in applications reasonably necessary and ancillary to the foregoing. Customer (i) represents and warrants to us that Customer has all necessary rights to grant us the foregoing rights, and (ii) agrees that neither Customer nor anyone else will be entitled to any compensation for our exercise of the foregoing rights.
<br><br>2. Customer Voluntary Suggestions. Some of the features of this website or the Services found at this website may allow Customer to view, post, publish, share, store, or manage (a) ideas, opinions, recommendations, feedback or advice (" Customer Feedback"), or (b) literary, artistic or other content, including but not limited to photos and videos (" Customer Submissions") (Customer Feedback together with Customer Submissions, " Customer Voluntary Suggestions"). By providing Customer Voluntary Suggestions to us via any method (e.g. site submission, email, survey responses, etc.), Customer represents and warrants to us that (i) Customer has all necessary rights to distribute Customer Voluntary Suggestions via this website or via the Services found at this website, either because Customer is the author of the Customer Voluntary Suggestions and has the right to distribute the same, or because Customer has the appropriate distribution rights, licenses and/or permissions to use, in writing, from the copyright or other owner of the Customer Voluntary Suggestions, and (ii) Customer does not violate the rights of any third party by providing the Customer Voluntary Suggestions.
<br><br>3. License. We will have the right to use and disclose any Customer Voluntary Suggestions posted to our websites or submitted directly to us for any lawful purpose. In no event will Customer or anyone else be entitled to any compensation or acknowledgement for our use of any Customer Voluntary Suggestions. Customer's provision of Customer Voluntary Suggestions is entirely voluntary and will not create any confidentiality obligation for us. By submitting Customer Voluntary Suggestions, Customer hereby grants us an irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, non-exclusive, fully-paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide license (sublicensable through multiple tiers) to: (a) use, copy, distribute, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, and publicly display Customer Voluntary Suggestions (or any modification thereto), in whole or in part, in any format, medium or application now known or later developed, and (b) use (and permit others to use) Customer Voluntary Suggestions in any manner and for any purpose (including, but not limited to, commercial purposes) that we deem appropriate in our sole discretion (including, but not limited to, to incorporating Customer Voluntary Suggestions (or any modification thereto), in whole or in part, into any technology, product or service. The provisions in this Section apply specifically to our use of Customer Voluntary Suggestions posted to our websites or submitted directly to us, and not to Customer’s hosted sites. Customer will be solely responsible for any and all of the Customer Voluntary Suggestions that are submitted through Customer’s account, and the consequences of, and requirements for, distributing it.
<br><br>4. Discussion Areas. We make no representations or warranties with respect to any forums, blogs, private messages, emails, or other electronic discussion mediums made available on or via the Services (collectively, " Discussion Areas") or with respect to any messages, information, or materials contained in the Discussion Areas. Customer's use of, or reliance upon, any such messages, information, or materials is at Customer's sole risk and expense. We do not, and cannot, review all of the information and materials provided in the Discussion Areas and have no responsibility or liability for any such information or materials or their use. If we become aware of any information or materials that we determine violate these Terms or the Discussion Areas' policies promulgated by us from time to time or that we otherwise deem inappropriate in our sole discretion, we reserve the right to delete, move, or edit any such information or materials.
<br><br><strong>EXPORT OF SERVICES OR TECHNICAL DATA
<br></strong>1. Customer may not remove or export from the United States of America or allow the export or re-export of the Services, or any direct product thereof, including technical data, in violation of any restrictions, laws, or regulations of  the United States of America or any other applicable country.
<br><br><strong>FEES AND PAYMENT; UPGRADE, DOWNGRADE AND CANCELLATION OF SERVICES
<br></strong>1. Fees. In consideration of the Services provided, Customer will pay us all fees due according to the prices and terms listed on this website. We reserve the right to modify our pricing and terms at any time, and such changes or modifications will be posted on this website and effective immediately upon the next renewal, billing period, upgrade or downgrade of the Services with and/or without notice to Customer. All payments are NON-REFUNDABLE.
<br><br>2. Taxes. All fees are exclusive of all federal, state, and/or other governmental sales, goods and services, value-added, harmonized or other taxes, fees or charges. Customer shall be responsible for all sales, goods and services, value-added, harmonized or other taxes, fees or charges.
<br><br>3. Billing Policies and Cycles. All billing invoices and payment notifications will be maintained directly in Customer's Account Portal. The billing cycle begins on the day Customer converts to a paid store (the "Billing Date") and is due on that day each month, partial year or year thereafter, depending on the Service plan selected and billing terms for individual Services. Billing related to the purchase of SSLs or Domains are billed once these products/services have been purchased by Customer.
<br><br>4. Payment. A valid credit card is required for accounts to process payment. We will automatically charge Customer's credit card on file based on Customer's billing cycle (monthly, partial yearly or yearly, depending on the Services selected and billing terms for individual Services) until Customer validly terminates the Services. Fees for prepaid Services are based on Services purchased, regardless of actual usage and payments made for such Services are NON-REFUNDABLE. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL DAYS, MONTHS OR YEARS AND DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS TO CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT USE THEIR ACCOUNTS OR LOG IN.
<br><br>5. Unpaid Accounts. Unpaid amounts are subject to a late payment charge of 1.5% per month, or the maximum legal rate allowed by law, whichever is less. If payment is not received within 30 calendar days of the billing date, we will automatically revoke access to Customer's account. We may or may not contact Customer directly to notify Customer of its unpaid account. Accounts past due over 90 days will automatically be deactivated.
<br><br>6. Disputed Charges/Billing Inquiries. It is Customer's obligation to review all charges for accuracy. Customer has 30 days from the date of billing to contact us and/or dispute the charge. Failure to do so within the specified time frame will constitute Customer's agreement that all charges are valid and Customer thereby waives any claims it may have had regarding such charge.
<br><br>7. Upgrades. Should Customer elect to upgrade its prepaid Services or if such Services are automatically upgraded pursuant to the last sentence of this Section 7.7, the Billing Date of the next renewal period will remain the same; however, Customer will be billed immediately for the pro-rata portion of the upgraded Services fee for the remainder of the current billing period. For example, if a month-to-month customer is billed on October 9th for monthly prepaid Services from October 9th to November 8th, and such Customer’s account is upgraded effective on October 30th, then such Customer will be charged immediately for the pro-rata usage of the upgraded plan from October 30th to November 8th. On November 9th such Customer will be charged for the full monthly fee amount of the upgraded plan.
<br><br>8. Downgrades. Should Customer elect to downgrade its prepaid Services, the downgrade will take effect on the commencement of the next renewal period. In other words, We DO NOT provide credits or refunds on downgrades that are effective during the applicable billing period (whether such period is a month, quarter or year). For example, if a month-to-month customer is billed on October 9th for prepaid Services from October 9th to November 8th and such customer downgrades the prepaid Services effective on October 30th, then the downgrade will take effect on the next billing date, i.e. November 9th.
<br><br>9. Cancellations. Our Services will continue in effect until Customer validly terminates the Services. Customer must notify us of its intent to terminate prepaid Services at least 5 calendar days before the billing renewal date. If notice is not received before such date, such Services will automatically renew for the subsequent renewal period. For example, if a month-to-month customer is billed on October 9th for monthly prepaid Services from October 9th to November 8th and such customer provides a valid notice to terminate its account on November 6th, Customer will automatically be charged for prepaid Services from November 9th to December 8th and the prepaid Services will terminate on December 8th. If the same customer provides notice to terminate its account on November 4th, then the account will terminate on November 8th and such customer will not be charged for any further prepaid Services on such account.
<br><br>10. Refund Policy. All purchases are final and non-refundable. Payment is required upon satisfactory completion of services.
<br><br><strong>PROHIBITED PRACTICES
<br></strong>1. Prohibited Offerings. Customer may not utilize the Services for unlawful, obscene, offensive or fraudulent content or activity, such as advocating or causing harm, interfering with or violating the integrity or security of a network or system, evading filters, sending unsolicited, abusive or deceptive messages, viruses or harmful code, or violating third party rights.
<br><br>2. Profanity. Profanity, profane or otherwise inappropriate subject matter in the site content and in the domain name are prohibited.
<br><br>3. Private Information and Images. Customers may not post or disclose any personal or private information about or images of children or any third party without the consent of such party (or a parent's consent in the case of a minor).
<br><br>4. Violations of Intellectual Property Rights. Any violation of any person's or entity's intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, rights of publicity or other personal rights is prohibited. We may remove or block access to content appearing on or through the Services upon receipt of proper notice of copyright infringement (see "Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement" below).
<br><br>5. Misrepresentation of Transmission Information. Forging, misrepresenting, omitting, or deleting message headers, return mailing information and/or Internet protocol addresses to conceal or misidentify the origin of a message is prohibited.
<br><br>6. Viruses and Other Destructive Activities. Use of the Services for creating or sending Internet viruses, worms or Trojan horses, or for pinging, flooding or mail bombing, or engaging in denial of service attacks is prohibited. It is also prohibited for Customer to engage in other activity that is intended to disrupt or interfere with, or that results in the disruption of or interference with, the ability of others to effectively use the Services (or any connected network, system, service or equipment) or conduct their business over the Internet.
<br><br>7. Hacking. "Hacking" and related activities are prohibited. "Hacking" includes, but is not limited to, the following activities: illegally or without authorization, accessing computers, accounts or networks, penetrating or attempting to penetrate security measures, port scans, stealth scans, and other activities designed to assist in hacking.
<br><br>8. Anonymous Proxies. We do not allow the use of anonymous proxy scripts on its servers. They can be very abusive to the server resources, affecting all users on that server. Customer will not access or copy any portion of the Services through any automated viewing, downloading or crawling systems.
<br><br>9. Export Control Violations. The exportation of encryption software outside of the United States of America and/or violations of United States of America law relating to the exportation of software is prohibited. Customer may not export or transfer, directly or indirectly, any regulated product or information to anyone outside United States of America without complying with all applicable statues, codes, ordinances, regulations, and rules imposed by United States of America federal, state or local law, or by any other applicable law.
<br><br>10. Child Pornography. The use of the Services to store, post, display, transmit, sell, advertise or otherwise make available child pornography is prohibited. We are required by law to, and will, notify law enforcement agencies when it becomes aware of the presence of child pornography on, or being transmitted through, the Services.
<br><br>11. Other Illegal Activities. The use of the Services to engage in any activity that is determined by us, in our sole and absolute discretion, to be illegal is prohibited. Such illegal activities include, but are not limited to, storing, posting, displaying, transmitting, selling or otherwise making available ponzi or pyramid schemes, fraudulently charging credit cards or displaying credit card information of third parties without their consent, and failure to comply with applicable online privacy laws. We will cooperate fully with appropriate law enforcement agencies in connection with any and all illegal activities occurring on or through the Services.
<br><br>12. Other Activities. This list of prohibitions provides examples of prohibited conduct, and is not intended to be a complete or exclusive list of all prohibitions. Engaging in any activity that, in our sole and absolute discretion, disrupts, interferes with or is harmful to (or threatens to disrupt, interfere with, or be harmful to) the Services, our business, operations, reputation, goodwill, customers and/or customer relations, or the ability of our customers to effectively use the Services is prohibited. Such prohibited activities include making available any program, product or service that is designed to or could be used to violate these Terms. In addition, the failure of Customer to cooperate with us in correcting or preventing violations of these Terms by, or that result from the activity of, a customer, patron, subscriber, invitee, visitor, or guest of Customer constitutes a violation of these Terms by Customer. Without limiting the rights and remedies available to it, We reserve the right in its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate Customer's access to its account and the Services, with or without notice, and to take any other action that we determine in our sole discretion is necessary as a result of any behavior by Customer that is illegal, inappropriate, disruptive to this website, the Services, or to any other user of this website or the Services, or which otherwise breaches these Terms. We may report to law enforcement authorities any actions that may be illegal, and any reports it receives of such conduct. When legally required, or otherwise in our sole discretion, we will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged illegal activity conducted using this website or the Services. These prohibitions do not require us to monitor, police, remove or reject any content, information, graphics, photographs or links on Customer’s hosted sites or any Customer Voluntary Suggestions or other information submitted by Customer or any other user.
<br><br><strong>BACKUP STORAGE
<br></strong>We do not offer data storage services.
